Overall, we believe that we performed are tasks in a timely and organized manner. However, during the
first week of sprint2 being assigned we experienced a plethora of problems in trying to set up a
github repository. Only after the first weekend of the project were we able to start coding individually,
which set our progress back a bit. Using the burndown chart, we were able to assign idividual tasks to each
group member which allowed all of us to work independently and efficiently. However, once we started working
on our own portions of the sprint, we did largely forgo using the burndown chart. In future sprints we are
going to try to use this feature more in order to keep track of everybody's progress in a more organized
manner. All in all, we worked well as a group and are excited to move further with the project.
