Overall, we believe that that we once again performed efficiently for this sprint and we completed all the 
additions we wanted to add to the game. Additionally, we were able to work together very well
during the days where we all met as a group, specifically when we were making final bug fixes and game
testing features the days before the sprint was due. While all of us were able to spend a lot of time working 
together, there was also a lot of times where we spent long periods working alone during the assignment
period. This was because all of us had other acedemic and personal priorities such as, exams,  essays, 
getting vaccinated. We alleviated this by working much harder during the times that we were able to work on them.
Overall, we believe we worked very hard as a group and made substantial progress as a team. We are proud of our
game and may continue to work on it over the summer if we feel inclined.
