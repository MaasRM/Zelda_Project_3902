											Game Description
************************************************************************************************************
Wait at the Title Screen to get the story of the game and to see which items you can collect. Upon entering
the game you are able to view the shop in the area to the right (but you wont be able to buy anything yet)
or you can enter the dungeon right in front of you. From this point on you must explore our reworked 
dungeon in order to collect all three pieces of the Triforce to be able to beat the game. Our dungeon is
larger than the first one and filled with much more difficult enemies. Keys, hearts, fairies and rupees will
drop randomly from enemies. Hearts and fairies will recover health if picked up. Don't worry though too much
about the enemies, if you run out of health while exploring the dungeon you will faint and be sent back to
the island where you first began. There you can spend the rupees that you've collected to get better items 
and even buy some new outfits. Now that you're better prepared, you can try and explore the dungeon again. 
All of the enemies will respawn and you will have to keep looking for the Triforce pieces. Once you find a 
piece, Link will keep it if he faints. This is also true for various items found inside the dungeon such as
rupees, bombs, the candle, the boomerang, and the bow and arrow. Bombs will drop from enemies and the
boomerang will be a random drop from a Goriya enemy. Upon Collecting the third and final piece of the 
Triforce the game will transition to the ending sequence, congratulating you, and showing the credits.
