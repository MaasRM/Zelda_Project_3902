Overall, we believe that that we once again performed efficiently for this sprint, however, we underestimated
how much work we had to accomplish by the turn-in date. Additionally, we were able to work together very well
during the days where we all met as a group, specifically when we were making final bug fixes and implementing
final features the Monday that Sprint 4 was due. While all of us were able to spend a lot of time working 
together, there was also a lot of times where we spent long periods working alone during the assignment
period. This was because all of us had other acedemic and personal priorities such as, exams,  essays, 
getting vaccinated, and going home for Easter. We alleviated this by working much harder during the times
that we were able to work on them. Overall, we believe we worked very hard as a group and made substantial
progress as a team.
