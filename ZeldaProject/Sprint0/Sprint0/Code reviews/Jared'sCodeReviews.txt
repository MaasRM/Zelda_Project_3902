Review of FairyItem.cs
Written by Phil Brocker
Number of minutes taken to complete review: 5 minutes

Comments on Readability:
	- Very short class so readability is not based on much
	- Frame1 and frame2 are a bit vague but I assume it is the item animating
	- The main body of the code is part of the update method which is straight-forward checking the frame
	and changes which sprite to use/draw.

	Overall the code is very readable. There are very few fields and even fewer methods. Making it very clear
	what is going on in the class.

Review of Link.cs
Written by Riley Maas

Comments on Maintainability:
	- There are not as many magic numbers as I thought there would be in one of the main classes.
	- Use of enums is good
	- perhaps changing how the spritesheets are handled could reduce the amount of loading to be done multiple times

Hypothetical changes:
	- If it is possible, create an array or collection of the various spritesheets to be passed to the class. This
	will cause the spritesheets to be loaded one time rather than multiple times.
	- If prior comment is possible it will remove the need to pass the contentmanager to the class.
	- Remove unused variable from the class as it is only passed into a method and compared in if statements
